# Binary-Files-Function-Pointers-and-Variadic-Functions
Binary Files, Function Pointers and Variadic Functions - second year first semester's fourth C project

This project is a continuation of the [third C project](https://github.com/aviasd/Structs-Dynamic-Allocations-and-Text-Files).  
I added a support in binary files, and some more complex C Abilities.
